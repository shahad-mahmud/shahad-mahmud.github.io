### Giga Tech Limited

**Machine Learning Engineer** \| *October 2022 - Present*

My time at Giga Tech Limited has been a wonderful journey filled with learning and growth. Here, I've had the chance to dive into the world of NLP techniques, all with the goal of making NLP methods in the Bangla language even better. Along the way, I've become comfortable working with complex systems and handle critical tasks. It's been a great experience, full of teamwork, learning, and solving interesting challenges. At Giga Tech Limited, I -

- Accomplished the development and deployment of language model pre-training, data preparation, and fine-tuning pipelines (BERT, XLNet, GPT-2, T5) for the Bangla language.
- Spearheaded research initiatives resulting in the creation of a highly accurate rule-based Lemmatizer specifically designed for Bangla, achieving a 90.17% accuracy rate.
- Developed a comprehensive Bangla text processing toolkit, including normalization techniques that reduced data ambiguity by approximately 32% and streamlined text cleaning functionalities.
- Strengthened code reusability and collaboration by establishing an internal PyPI server for efficient package distribution and increased productivity.
