As machine learning enthusiasts, we often dedicate the lion's share of our attention, time, and effort to data preparation and model building. However, there's a crucial and often underestimated step that also deserves the spotlight: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO). In this blog post, we'll explore the world of HPO, shedding light on its significant impact. Discover how the right choice of hyperparameters can turbocharge your model's speed (both in training and inference) and boost its performance. Don't miss out on this essential aspect of machine learning success!

## What is a Hyperparameter?

Before we dive into the world of hyperparameter optimization (HPO), let's first understand what a hyperparameter is. When we train machine learning models, there are two types of parameters at play: model parameters and hyperparameters. Model parameters are the ones that adapt and learn during the training process as the model iterates through a dataset. In contrast, hyperparameters are the static settings that are established before the training begins.

üìù Hyperparameters are like the ground rules for our machine learning models. They're the settings we choose before we start training the model, and they have a big say in how well the model will perform. These settings essentially steer the learning process and have a major impact on the final results.
