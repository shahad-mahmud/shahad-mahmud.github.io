Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude 3, etc. have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling machines to generate human-like text with remarkable fluency and coherence. These powerful models, trained on vast amounts of data, have demonstrated an impressive ability to understand and generate language, opening up new possibilities in various applications such as content creation, creative writing, and conversational AI.

However, despite their impressive language generation capabilities, LLMs often lack the ability to produce factually accurate information. This limitation arises because LLMs are trained on vast datasets of text and learn patterns within the data, but they do not inherently understand or verify the facts. Again these data contain biases, inconsistencies, or outdated information. As a result, the generated text, although linguistically fluent, may not always align with real-world facts or the most up-to-date information. This phenomenon is often called a ‘hallucination’.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the language generation capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge sources, allowing the models to access and incorporate relevant factual information during the generation process.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG is a powerful technique that uses an external knowledge base (KB) to provide relevant and/or up-to-date information to the LLM. The knowledge base can be domain-specific documents, websites, or even PDFs. It powers the ‘chat with PDF’, ‘chat with website’ type applications. 

As depicted in Figure 1, a user’s query is used to retrieve relevant information from the KB and is passed to the LLM along with the query. Now the LLM has access to the facts or updated information to look at and generate its response. Generally, a RAG system has two key components:

1. **The Retriever:** Think of it as a super librarian with a massive digital library (the KB). The retriever searches through mountains of text data (articles, books, etc.) to find information relevant to a specific topic. It uses clever techniques like keyword matching or even fancy text analysis to identify the best sources.
2. **The Generator (LLM):** This is where the LLM, our powerful language model, comes in. The retriever feeds the LLM with the most relevant information it finds. Instead of having to dream up everything from scratch (hallucinating), the LLM has a solid foundation of real-world information to work with, ensuring a more accurate and informative response.
